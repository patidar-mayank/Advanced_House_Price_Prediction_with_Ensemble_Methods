# 🏡 Advanced House Price Prediction with Feature Engineering and Ensemble Methods

Welcome to the **Advanced House Price Prediction** project!  
This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting housing prices using sophisticated feature engineering and powerful ensemble machine learning techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to build accurate predictive models for house prices based on a real-world dataset (Melbourne housing market). By leveraging advanced feature engineering and combining multiple models through ensemble methods, we aim to achieve robust and reliable predictions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Comprehensive handling of missing values and irrelevant features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encoding categorical variables and optimizing feature selection.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - Stacking Ensemble (combining Random Forest & XGBoost with Gradient Boosting as final estimator)
- **Performance Evaluation**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² score for model comparison.
- **Reproducible Workflow**: All steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation are well-documented.
